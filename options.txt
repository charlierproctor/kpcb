Here's a small bash-like environment to play with the hash table:

The commands:
	set: stores the given key/value pair in the hash table.
	get: return the value associated with the given key, or null if no value is 
	set.
	delete: delete the value associated with the given key, returning the value 
	on success or null if the key has no value.
	load: return a float value representing the load factor.
	exit: exits the environment

Note: You will separately be prompted for the command,key,value as appropriate. 
In other words, one command / key / value per line... \n is the delimiter.

Try it out! Type 'set' to get started.
